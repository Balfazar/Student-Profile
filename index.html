              <h1> Personal Information </h1>
                <p> My name is Zain and am currently 19 years of age. I was born in New Zealand when my parents decided to move to Australia soon after my birth. Being brought up in Australia gave me an opportunity to have access to modern technology and realize how important it is. Ive always loved and had a passion to play video games competitively which came from me competing in soccer leagues. While I have little experience in the IT sector, I am willing to learn for a potential career path.</p>

     <h1> Interest in IT </h1>
     <p> Information Technology has played a major role in my life and in many others too. The role of technology that interests me is artificial intelligence and coding. The idea of creating something that can make its own decisions is captivating. Being surrounded with video games whilst growing up allowed me to explore the journey of new technology as well as improvements in overall gaming experience which brought me closer to technology. My father who had a job in the IT industry always helped with learning new information such as HTML and creating websites. </p>
     <p> Entering RMIT to learn IT was a great choice as it had good reputation of excellence in professional and vocational education, applied research, and engagement. Coming into RMIT I expect to learn the fundamentals of Information technology for a good foundation to start a career path for my future. This includes learning the uses of IT and how to code.</p>

     <h1> Ideal Job </h1>
     <h2> Automation Engineer </h2>

     <h3> Description </h3>
     <p> Automation Engineering is a career that has stood out to me in various ways. Raspberry pi begun my curiosity in automation when I realized the possibilities were endless. Automation Engineers are responsible for the development of machines that automatically control appliances which save money, time and reduce human effort. It has application in everyday life including in businesses or even for home uses.  Automation Engineers require skills like coding and scripting, having teamwork skills, and leadership. </p>

     <h3> Skills I Have </h3>
     <p> My current skills include having beginner coding skills in HTML.</p>

     <h3> Plan to learn required skills </h3>
     <ol>
         <li>	Become familiar and create a strong foundation in coding/scripting languages. </li>
         <li>	Learn to communicate with people in my field with good teamwork skills. </li>
         <li>	Take initiative by doing the correct things. </li>
     </ol>

     <h1> Personal Profile </h1>
     <h2> Myers-Briggs's test</h2>
     <p>  Type:  Turbulent Logician
          Code: INTP-T  </p>
     <p>  (Strength) Open-Minded – Logicians couldn’t make these connections if they thought they knew it all – they are highly receptive to alternate theories, so long as they’re supported by logic and facts. In more subjective matters like social norms and traditions, Logicians are usually liberal, with a “none of my business” sort of attitude – peoples’ ideas are what matter. </p>

     <p> (Weakness) Second-Guess Themselves – Logicians remain so open to new information that they often never commit to a decision at all. This applies to their own skills as well – Logician personalities know that as they practice, they improve, and any work they do is second-best to what they could do. Unable to settle for this, Logicians sometimes delay their output indefinitely with constant revisions, sometimes even quitting before they ever begin. </p>

     <h2> Learning Style Test </h2>
     <p> Auditory: 25%
         Visual: 35%
         Tactile: 40% </p>

     <h2> Big Five Personality Test </h2>

     <h3> What they mean to me </h3>
     <p> The Myers Briggs test gave me an insight on why and how my personality would normally react to situations through making decisions with logic. The Learning Style test helped me understand that I learn more effectively through physical forms rather than auditory. Whereas my results from the big five personality test showed that I have negative emotions holding me back to reach my full potential, giving me something to improve in. </p>

     <h3> Influence in a team </h3>
     <p> My results for the Myers Briggs test would determine my place in a team environment to be quite impactful due to the creative ideas as well as abstract problem-solving solutions I can bring. Tactile learning in a team environment can bring more communication towards team members which makes it easier and more fun to learn for everyone. Having heavy negative emotions can negatively impact my performance in a team environment as I would miss out on opportunities for growth. </p>

     <h3> Forming a team </h3>
     <p> When forming a team, communication will play a major role for its success. Having setbacks due to negative emotions can be prevented by communication with everyone on the team. Having a clear goal is also extremely important as it ensures everyone is putting effort into their work. The three results were mostly accurate, which helped me understand myself even better. </p>

     <h1> Project Idea </h1>
     <h2> Raspberry Pi Curtain controller with remote/Light senor  </h2>

     <h3> Overview </h3>
     <p> The Project idea that I thought of is an automated sunlight censored curtain opener. It consists of a UV light sensor which detects sunlight causing the curtain to automatically open without contact. This encourages better sleeping habits which is a vital element in everyone's lives. The project will consist of a raspberry pi which will be programmed using a programming language named python.  </p>

     <h3> Motivation </h3>
     <p> Studies have shown that “waking up to sunlight directly places your body's inner clock ready for the day also known as your circadian rhythm.” Sunlight sends a mental signal for your body to wake up and start becoming alert. Whereas when the lights start to become dimmer during nighttime the body will naturally start to become sleepy again. The ongoing health benefits for waking up to sunlight supports the automated curtain opener. With the help of raspberry pi, the automated sunlight censored curtain opener can help build healthy sleeping habits for millions around the world. </p>

     <h3> Description </h3>
     <p> The automated project is to be created using raspberry pi and a programming language named python. The automated machine will be programmed to follow a set of commands. The commands include the opening of the curtain when the UV sensor is detected as the sunlight. The curtain will then automatically open itself reveling a bright room of sunshine. When the UV sensor no longer can detect a sunlight source then it will send a command to close the curtains back up. The UV sensors can be replaced or added on to a wireless remote controller, or a voice-controlled command using Alexa. The machine will be running on a micro servo motor and will be in a set rotating motion when a command is received. The gears will act accordingly to the commands whether it's pushing away or pulling in. A remote controller will also be attached to the machine as another way of functioning the curtains for other reasons (closing due to sunshine). The automated curtains will better impact your sleep quality and ensure that you          wake up fully energized and focused for the day. Its role is to naturally fix your circadian rhythm. The moment the curtain closes or opens gives a mental reminder to the person that it is time to wake up or go to bed. Another feature is the motion sensor is used to determine the dimensions of any curtain holder and automatically stop or go for the commands to take place. A virtual app can also be created for setting up a timer or simply just normal control through Wi-Fi connection for more convenience. </p>

     <h3> Tools and Technologies </h3>
     <p> The hardware required for this project consist of having a Raspberry pi, a servo motor, raspberry Pi USB wireless adapter, UV light sensor, a microphone and a remote controller. The software required for programming the project will have Raspberry Pi 2 Noobs, Apache web server and wiring Pi. </p>

     <h3> Skills Required </h3>
     <p> Skills that will be needed to accomplish a successful automated curtain machine include having the beginner knowledge to code using python. Being familiar with electricity can be an advantage when dealing with automations such as the servo motors. Raspberry pi is a cheap and easily accessible tool that is used in this project that also requires basic knowledge. </p>

     <h3> Outcome </h3>
     <p> The finalized project will encourage healthy sleeping habits in an efficient and effective manner. Waking up to sunlight has shown to have many health benefits for the body and mind. Having an automated curtain controller will naturally fix your circadian rhythm by opening and closing your curtains by detecting sunlight. This can not only help people with sleeping disorders but will even benefit normal people. </p>
